This code implements a Tic Tac Toe game in a Linux kernel module. 
The game board is represented by a 3x3 array, and there are two 
players, X and O. Users can interact with the game via a character 
device, which supports reading the board state and writing commands 
like TURN, RESET, and BOARD. The AI can make moves using a random 
move generator. The code contains functions for resetting the board,
checking for valid moves, making moves, checking for a winner, and 
handling AI moves. It also implements read and write functions for 
the character device, along with initialization and exit functions 
for the kernel module. The kernel module is registered as a 
miscellaneous character device, allowing users to interact with it 
via file operations.

COMMANDS:
"sudo cat /dev/tictactoe":this shows the game grid
"echo "TURN 0 0" | sudo tee /dev/tictactoe > /dev/null": how to make a play
"dmesg | tail" checks kernel log messages"
"echo "RESET" | sudo tee /dev/tictactoe > /dev/null": rest the game
